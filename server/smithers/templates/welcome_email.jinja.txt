Welcome to the NVSL progress reporting system.

This is a web-based system we use for submitting progress reports.

Please visit {{url}} to set up your account.  You can sign in with your '{{email}}' google account.

The first time you log in, it will ask you to set some stuff up.  Set your meeting day if you know it, otherwise set it to Monday.

It will also ask you to read and agree to a set of group expectations and policies.  These are important, I take them very seriously, and so should you.  Please read them closely.  We can discuss them further when we meet next.
