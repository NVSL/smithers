<h1 >	Research Exams</h1>
<p>Steven Swanson (swanson@cs.ucsd.edu)</p>
<p >This document describes my suggestions and guidelines for taking your research exam. <strong>Read them carefully.</strong> Their goal is to help ensure that you pass, and they are based on problems that students have had in the past. Please pay attention to them. If you don't pass your research exam on the first try, it will disrupt your research and probably extend your time in grad school.</p>
<h2 >Overview</h2>
<p >The research exam is the first milestone along the way to your PhD. It's goal is to enuse that you have the skill necessary to acquire breadth and depth of knowledge in an area of computer science, that you can synthesize that knowledge to, e.g., motivate further research, and present that knowledge and synthesis in writing and in a talk. If you take your research exam seriously, it will help you develop as a researcher and lay a good foundation for your thesis work. You'll also learn a great deal. </p>
<h2 >Before the Exam</h2>
<p >You need to be thinking about your research exam a long time before you actually take it. It is one of several milestones you'll pass on the way to getting a Ph.D.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Keep track of your deadline.</strong> It is your responsibility to track the deadline for you to complete the research exam. You should let me know about 6 months before the deadline that we need to start thinking about it. We will decide on a timeline either for you to do the exam or for us to touch base again. It's your responsibility to follow up at the agreed upon time.</li>
  <li><strong>Read about the exam and its requirements. </strong>The official description of the research exam is <a href="http://cse.ucsd.edu/node/215">here</a> and <a href="http://cse.ucsd.edu/node/216">here</a>. Please read it through and make sure you under what's expected of you and when different components are due.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose a topic. </strong>We will decide on a topic for your exam. The research exam is an opportunity for you to acquire depth of knowledge in an area that will help you in carrying out your thesis research. Before we discuss your topic, think about several potential topics that would be helpful in this regard.  This is an important part of the research exam exercise: Identifying an area of knowledge that will support your research, and it requires thinking critically about how your research fits into the other areas of computer science. As part of this process you will identify 4-5 key papers that will form the starting point for the exam.</li>
  <li><strong>Form your committee.</strong>The graduate coordinator will assign you a chair for your research exam committee. You should let me know as soon as this happens. Contact your chair and set up a meeting. During this meeting you'll typically discuss who else should be on the committee. Before agreeing to the entire committee, you should discuss it with me first. This is very important.</li>
  <li><strong>Develop an outline for your exam. </strong>Research exams can take many shapes. For example, they can contain varying amounts of original research and cover varying &quot;breadths&quot; of material at varying &quot;depths.&quot; Developing the outline will make sure your topic area is of appropriate scope and help to align your committee's expectations with your goals.</li>
  <li><strong>Discuss your topic with the committee. </strong>Once the committee and topic are set, you should meet with each member of your committee to discuss your outline with them and clarify their expectations. This a very important step, since it helps ensure that you and your committee will have the same understanding of what your research exam is about, how it relates to your research, and what you are going to cover.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule your exam. </strong>Scheduling things with multiple faculty is very difficult. Start as soon as your committee is formed, and be tenacious.  Make sure to include me in the scheduling process so I can attend your exam. Do not assume that your date and time are set until you have confirmed them with all your committee members. It is not sufficient for them to say they are free on a given day, that doesn't hold the time or get it on their calendar. Students often say this is the hardest part of the exam.</li>
  <li><strong>Read several example exams.</strong> Instructions for retrieving example exams is <a href="http://cse.ucsd.edu/node/217">here</a>. I recommend in particular, /cse/grad/ResearchExams/2012-13/su12mconley.pdf.</li>
  </ol>
<h2>The Research Exam Report</h2>
<p>Your research exam document is a synthesis of existing work in your topic area and your own research. You will already be well-versed in your own research, so the main tasks to accomplish are 1) to learn about other work in the area, 2) to perform the synthesis, and 3) writing the paper.</p>
<p>Here are some points to keep in mind while gathering knowledge about your topic area.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Read lots of papers. </strong>Most of the information you will need to cover is in research papers. As a guideline you should read betwen 30 and 60 papers in the course of preparing your exam and skim many more. A good place to start is with the key papers mentioned above. Read them, identify key references, read those papers, identify key references, etc. You can also use <a href="http://portal.acm.org">ACM Portal</a> to perform forward citation searches as well. </li>
  <li><strong>Collect bibtex. </strong>As you are collecting papers, gather bibtex entries as you go. This make life much easier later.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep organized. </strong>Find some method (digital or paper based) to keep track of the papers you've read and your notes on them. Talk to other grad students about the tools they've used for this purpose.</li>
  <li><strong>Don't worry about straying far afield. </strong> You'll run into all sorts of interesting papers in your reading. Keep an open mind about what you add to your reading list. It may not end up in the final document, but it'll help broaden your perspective.</li>
  </ol>
<p>The synthesis aspect of the exam is where students run into the most trouble. It is also the most important part of the exam, since it is what research is all about.  Just cataloging all the papers in area is not enough, you must be able to draw broader conclusions about the state of research in the area, where open problems lie, and where an area has been throroughly covered by previous work. You should devote a significant amount of time to this portion of the exam. Here are some hints for generating good synthesis (not all of them apply to all exams), and you may find other approaches by looking at old exams:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Build a taxonomy. </strong>This is a very common approach to a research exam, since it forces you to categorize and organize existing work in the field. Building the taxonomy is not enough, however. You also need to think about the taxonomy and what it says about the area. Are there obvious blank spots in the taxonomy? Why are they there? Can you see a way to fill them? Would it be a good idea? How can your work enable that? (Example: Consider Flynn's Taxonomy: We have SIMD, and MIMD, SISD. What about MISD?)</li>
  <li><strong>Think about the future.</strong> After reading all those papers, you have a good idea of where the field has been. Where should it go now? Why? What will the benefits be? Is it worth the effort? What will the challenges be? How would emerging technologies help? (Example: Signaling and power consumption have limited DRAM memory system scalability, but optical interconnects could relieve these problems, enabling new classes of servers).</li>
  <li><strong>Compare to other fields.</strong> Have similar ideas or techniques been applied to other areas or fields? What lessons can we learn from their experiences? What ideas can we borrow? How is this situation different? How is it the same? (Example: OS bypass has already been explored for networking, but applying it similar ideas to storage raises different challenges).</li>
  </ol>
<p>Your synthesis is only useful to others if you present it clearly in your document. Also, your document is the first part of your exam that your committee will see, so it's important that it be of high quality. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Write a good paper.</strong> Please review my <a href="url_for('student_ops.render_resource', file='WritingPapers.html')}}">notes on writing papers.</a> This is probably the first time you will produce a paper on your own in graduate school.  If you start a bit early on the writing, it will be a more leisurely process than our usual paper deadlines. Take advantage of this opportunity to improve your writing.</li>
  <li><strong>Get me a draft early. </strong> You should get me a nearly-complete draft of your paper 2 weeks before you need to turn it in to your committee. I will provide feedback to help you improve it. Account for this time in your schedule for completing your exam on time.</li>
  <li><strong>Cite your sources. </strong>It's critical that you cite your sources correctly, and follow the guidance for academic honesty descibed <a href="{{url_for('student_ops.render_resource', file='Expectations.html')}}">here</a>. This is especially important for your research exam since much of the document will cover the work of others.</li>
  <li><strong>Write it in LaTex and make it look like a research paper. </strong>This is what we use for writing papers, so it's what you should use for the RE as well.  It should be formatted single space, two column, etc., just like our research papers.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The  Research Exam Presentation</h2>
<p>Your research exam presentation is just as important as your document. No matter how good your document is, if you  cannot present your work clearly to your committee, you cannot expect to do well. Prepare your talk carefully, and practice extensively.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare a good presentation. </strong>Please review my <a href="{{url_for('student_ops.render_resource', file='GivingTalks.html')}}">notes on giving good talks</a>. This is probably the longest presentation you have prepared, so budget your time to prepare it accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice, Practice, Practice.</strong> You should give many practice talks for your presentation. 10-15 practices on your own would be a good start.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule a practice talk with architecture students. </strong> You should schedule  a practice talk with other members of my group and the architecture group in general.  Your talk should be complete and well practiced by this point, otherwise it's not a good use of your fellow students' time. Pay especially close attention to the comments of more senior students who've been through their exams.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule a praticte talk with me. </strong> After you have implemented the feedback from the student practice talk, you should give me a practice talk as well. Think of this as a dress rehersal. It should occur at least 1 week before your scheduled exam, so you have time to implement the changes I suggest and reherse the modified talk.</li>
  <li><strong>Give a good presentation. </strong>On the day of your exam, you should be in &quot;business casual&quot; clothes. Be sure to be on time and well-rested. If you have followed all of the above advice, you'll be all set to give a great talk! Show your committee what you've got!</li>
  </ol>
<p>That's it! The research exam is a great opportunity to expand your horizons and practice writing, speaking, and synthesizing. Following the above guidance will help you make the most of it.</p>
